<p>I am Shahbaz Ahmed, a software engineer currently living in Mumbai, India. I am passionate about programming in Android and backend development. I created this blog to encourage myself to program daily and to keep a track of my learnings and side projects.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to watch TV shows and read cool articles on various topics such as tech, current affairs. Soon I would like to add reading books in my hobby list. So if you got any suggestions for good reads, it will be most welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by. :smile:</p>
